flask-simple
============

flask-simple is an extension for `Flask`_ that makes using Amazon's `SimpleDB`_
NoSQL database *incredibly simple* and enjoyable.

SimpleDB is a NoSQL database, 100% hosted by Amazon, which allows you to store
any variable JSON data.  All fields are indexed automatically, so no table
schema is necessary -- and the best part is that you can query records via SQL.
